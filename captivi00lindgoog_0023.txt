PLA UTINE Pltosom‘. 13

ωηο situation would sound (as we find it spelt on old inscrip-
tions) dede3 even the hnal ·nt oi Mouet was laxily dropped
in pronunciation, and the word made to mund deden. Plautus
allows all these pronunciatione in his verses-

Capt. r. ud estne luvocatu‘ en non esti est planiswtme

„ Μ. 11 sumu’ quarn servimus.
„ 1. a. ις ita u' dicis.

Ennius, however, established it as a usage ior all subsequent
poetry, tliat certain ol thern should be allowed and others not
allowed. He allowed, or rather enloroed, the dropping ol hnal
m when the next word began with a vowel or λς mium,
habuit, lor example, was necessarily pronounced amabu' hadwi,
so that the last syllable ol amrium ending in the vowel w (now
that them was dropped) was ellded belore the initial syllable
ι ol habm't. But in a case lilre amicum perdidit, where the word
¹following the final m began with a consonant, the m was not
allowed to be dropped. The words could not scan amt'csl’ per·
didit, but only anucam pam-t. lle also allowed, but did not
enforce, the elislon ol final s belone an initlal consonant, a

practice which was, however, dropped by the Augustae poets, ’

although it leit its traces even in prose literature in the double
lomus ol the and sing. pass. aman's and emere, etc. But he
did not allow linal t, w, dor any other consonant to be dropped,
although tbe lorrn ol the 3td plur. perf. ind in -η lor -uent
forced its way both into poetry and prose.

Plautus’ versa, then, belong to a time when the metrical
lawe, to which all later Latin poetry conlormed, had not yet
been fixed. They reproduce the ordinary pronunciation ol
everydaylile, much more than the artificial language ol later
Latin poetry¹, and that ia what Cicero meant when be said ’
