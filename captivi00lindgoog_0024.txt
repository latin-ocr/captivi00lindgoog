‘numerus et versus’ οἰ Ennius, Lucretius, and the like] olleo

For a tull list oi Plautus' divergences iu scansion (i. e. pro- 4

nunciation) oi words from the usage os classica} poetry, we
retes the render to Ritschl’s Protegmm, and content ourselves
with noticing the most important under three hesds :-

(ι) Neglect α’ Position in some disyllabis words os onustant Ι
