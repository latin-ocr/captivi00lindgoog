One great maron why Plautus’ lines ure hurd to econ ie that
he lived earlier than Ennius, who introduced most ol the
’ metrical lawe by which classical Latin poetry ie bound, und
who gave the Latin langunge a distinct literary ehape. Ennius,
r'or instance, mode it n usage oi Latin poetry thul n short vowel
might be treated us long before two consonante, euch os crin '
the middle oia word. This usage urus unknown to Plautus,
'uand so in hir lines such n word as sacrum ir never scanned
sacrum. Again‚ in Ennius' time the consonante, m, s,l‚ rud
